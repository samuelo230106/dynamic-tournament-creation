# dynamic-tournament-creation

a tournament creation method that intends to increase the chance of better contestants later on in the tournament

using this in a game i was making, but found the entire process interesting - and decided to expand and explain here.

the aim of this process is: given a list of contestants who all have a numerical rank (higher better lower worse, base rank 60), how best can we generate a bracketed tournament - to maximise the number of matches played but to also increase the quality of the tournament by making sure that the highest rank players are more likely to reach the latter stages of the tournament (this can be considered controversial, as it may not give opportunities for lower rank, newer players to progress - however, i have largely ignored this but may come back to this issue in the future).
